# My_CRM_MVC_Project
A dynamic web application using Servlet, JSP, and Oracle Database that can perform CRUD operations.

The application is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which made it 
easier to organize and manage the code. With MVC, the application's logic is separated 
into three interconnected components: the model (which represents the data), the view 
(which displays the data), and the controller (which handles user input and manages the
communication between the model and view).

Using these technologies and architecture, I was able to develop a web application that 
can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) data from the database, making it an excellent
tool for managing information in a variety of contexts.
